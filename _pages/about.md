I’m passionate about Machine Learning Systems with a strong background in building scalable platforms, performance optimization, and full-stack development. With experience spanning algorithmic trading, systems observability, and cloud native platforms, I thrive at the intersection of software engineering and cutting-edge technologies. My work focuses on creating robust, efficient systems that drive innovation and improve performance.

In my spare time, I enjoy staying active and challenging myself. I’ve recently taken up tennis and am working on improving my game. To stay fit, I practice running and strength training to build muscle and lose weight. When I’m not working on my physical fitness, I love traveling to capture stunning nature views through photography.

I'm also a dedicated gamer. My recent favorite is Elden Ring, though I’ve yet to find time to dive into Black Myth: Wu Kong, despite its popularity. And yes, I'm a meat lover, always up for a good steak!

**Let’s Connect**:

I’m always open to discussing exciting opportunities, whether it’s collaborating on a project, building machine learning systems, or optimizing performance at scale.
